A static-dynamic security analysis tool for [DOM clobbering](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/dom-clobbering) vulnerabilities based on [JAW-v1](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/releases/tag/v1.1.5) and [Iroh](https://github.com/maierfelix/Iroh). TheThing can be used for analyzing the client-side of web applications.

**Note:** The source code of TheThing has been merged with [JAW](https://soheilkhodayari.github.io/JAW/), resulting in [JAW-v2](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/releases/tag/v2.0.1). Accordingly, this repository now uses [JAW-v2](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/releases/tag/v2.0.1) as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

## ‚ú® What is DOM Clobbering? 


[DOM Clobbering](https://portswigger.net/web-security/dom-based/dom-clobbering) is an attack technique where the attacker achieves arbitrary client-side code execution by injecting a non-script HTML markup into a vulnerable webpage and transform the initially secure markup into executable code. 

DOM Clobbering originates from a naming collision between JavaScript variables and [named HTML markups](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#named-access-on-the-window-object), where attackers confuse the web application by injecting HTML elements whose `id` or `name` attribute matches the name of security-sensitive variables, such as variables used for fetching remote content (e.g., script `src`). 

For more information, See [here](https://soheilkhodayari.github.io/DOMClobbering/domc_wiki).


## ‚û∞ Overview 

TheThing comprises three building block components: 

- **[Web Crawler](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/tree/master/crawler):** given a single seed URL of a webapp under test, collects its webpages' resources (e.g., scripts).
- **[Static Analyzer](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/tree/master/analyses/domclobbering):** detects DOM Clobbering sources and sinks and potential data flows among them.
- **[Dynamic Analyzer](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/tree/master/dynamic):** checks the clobberability of the identified sources, and the data flows. 


The architecture of the TheThing is shown below.

## üè≠ Installation

The source code of TheThing has been merged with [JAW](https://soheilkhodayari.github.io/JAW/), resulting in [JAW-v2](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/releases/tag/v2.0.1). As such, this repository now uses [JAW-v2](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW/releases/tag/v2.0.1) as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).


To clone TheThing and its submodule `JAW-v2.x`, you can do:
```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/TheThing
```

Alternatively, do:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/TheThing
$ cd TheThing
$ git clone https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/JAW --branch v2.0.4  
```

Then, copy the JAW's content into the root directory:
```bash
$ cp -rf ./JAW/* ./
```

Finally, get the necessary dependencies via:
```bash
$ ./install.sh
```

This will install the required `npm` and `python` libraries, and the `chromium` driver.


**Note:** You can also download the pre-packaged code from the [releases](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/TheThing/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section or the [stable](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/TheThing/tree/stable) branch.



## üöÄ Running


You can run an instance of the pipeline in a background screen via: 
```bash
$ screen -dmS s1 bash -c 'python3 -m run_domclobbering --conf=config.domclobbering.yaml; exec sh'
```

The CLI provides the following options:

```
$ python3 -m run_domclobbering -h

usage: run_domclobbering.py [-h] [--conf FILE] [--site SITE] [--list LIST] [--from FROM] [--to TO]

This script runs the tool pipeline.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --conf FILE, -C FILE  pipeline configuration file. (default: config.domclobbering.yaml)
  --site SITE, -S SITE  website to test; overrides config file (default: None)
  --list LIST, -L LIST  site list to test; overrides config file (default: None)
  --from FROM, -F FROM  the first entry to consider when a site list is provided; overrides config file (default: -1)
  --to TO, -T TO        the last entry to consider when a site list is provided; overrides config file (default: -1)

```


**Configuration:** TheThing expects a `.yaml` config file as input. See [config.domclobbering.yaml](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/TheThing/blob/master/config.domclobbering.yaml) for an example.


**Running Building Blocks:** For documentation on how to run each building block of the tool individually, see [here](https://github.com/SoheilKhodayari/TheThing/tree/master/docs/thething.md).
